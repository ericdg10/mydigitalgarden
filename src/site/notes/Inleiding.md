## Welcome to My Site!
Thanks for visiting. I have [[other pages\|other pages]] as well as **bold text**, *italic text*, ~~strikethrough text~~ and I can share code: `<p></p>` and more!

This is another paragraph.

You will want to click on the icon in the green box or press on CTRL/CMD + P to bring up the command palette and search for “Digital Garden”. Publish Single Note" command. Press enter.. It will take a few minutes and you can track the status under the Deploys sidebar tab on Netlify. Once you see the green **Published** flag, you can refresh your link and you should see the page uploaded.

Now you can add more pages and change whatever you would like. Only pages that have the `dg-publish` property/YAML on them will come up to publish. That is how I am able to store my private notes in the same vault as my Digital Garden. It makes it A LOT easier than having to change vaults whenever I want to take notes or work on my garden(s).
